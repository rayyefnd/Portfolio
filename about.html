        <div class="about-text">
            <p>Computer Science student at BINUS University with a strong interest in software engineering. 
                My journey began with curiosity about how the applications I frequently use are built, 
                which unexpectedly led me deeper into the world of Computer Science and inspired me to explore the field further. 
                Through academic projects and collaborative work, I've gained hands-on experience in addressing real-world problems, particularly in front-end development. 
                Beyond contributing to various projects, I'm also actively involved in communities such as the Bina Nusantara Computer Club. 
                These experiences have helped me strengthen not only my technical skills but also my abilities in collaboration, communication, and problem-solving. 
                I'm eager to continue learning and growing so that I can contribute even more by creating meaningful digital solutions.
