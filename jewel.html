            <p>This project is a website developed using ASP .NET for a jewelry store, 
                with SAP Crystal Report integrated for income reporting. 
                The main objective is to simplify order management while providing customers with the convenience of searching for and purchasing jewelry online from home. 
                The system defines three roles, user, admin, and guest (non-logged-in user), each with different levels of access to the website's features. 
                Additionally, the project applies the concept of Domain-Driven Design as a practical implementation of the knowledge we acquired during that semester.</p>

                        <h2>Challanges</h2>
                        <p> The main challenge we faced was the difficulty in understanding the structure of .NET, as this was a new subject introduced during the semester, which made the development process more time-consuming. In addition, the income reporting feature using SAP Crystal Reports encountered several issues, such as reports not being displayed properly. However, we were able to resolve these problems through multiple trials and errors.</p>
