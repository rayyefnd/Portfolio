            <p><b>GreenLoop</b> is a waste management platform that allows users to conveniently schedule trash pickups. As a 
                reward, users earn points that can be redeemed for vouchers or other items. The platform also provides updates 
                on environmental issues, waste education, and sustainability through news and articles displayed on the 
                dashboard.

                    <h2>Challanges</h2>
                    <p> During the development process, we often faced challenges such as difference of ideas, technical issues, and 
                        business logic. At first, it was difficult to keep tasks on schedule, and we even had to redo the entire plan. To 
                        overcame this, we organized daily brainstorming sessions after class, reviewed successful past projects, and 
                        analyzed feedback from our lecturer during weekly presentations. We also worked on keeping documentation 
                        clear, which helped improve communication and allowed the team to collaborate more smoothly.</p>
