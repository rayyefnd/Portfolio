        <div class="explanation">
            <p> This system is designed to detect the number of vehicles at an intersection in order to reduce 
                congestion on one side of the lane. The system determines which lanes have heavier congestion and 
                adjusts the green light accordingly. This system is also able to detect special vehicles such as 
                ambulances, fire trucks, and government vehicles, allowing them to pass through the intersection 
                without delay by giving them priority

                        <h2>Challanges</h2>
                        <p>One of the main challenges we faced was implementing AI logic, as it required not only understanding 
                        the algorithms but also adapting them to the real world. We overcome this problem through trial and 
                        error experiments and close collaboration within the team, which ultimately enhanced our problem 
                        solving skills and provided valuable insights into AI implementation.
